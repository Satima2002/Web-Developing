  <h2>15 facts you might not know about Antoine de Saint-Exupéry:</h2>
  <section id="tribute-info">
    <ol>
      <li>Antoine de Saint-Exupéry was born on June 29, 1900 in Lyon, France to an aristocratic family. </li>
      <li>Saint-Exupéry was an inventive child, conducting bathtub experiments, attaching wings to his bicycle and writing poetry about his home, four siblings and mother.
</li>
      <li>Between 1900 and 1940, France was fascinated by aviation. Swept up in the notion of flying, Saint-Exupéry experienced his first flight at age 12.
</li>
       
      <li>Saint-Exupéry was profoundly shaped by two deaths in his youth: his father Jean in 1904 and his younger brother Francois, with whom he was very close, in 1917.
</li>
      <li>In a 1941 interview with Harper's Bazaar, Saint-Exupéry revealed that the first book he ever loved was a collection of Hans Christian Andersen fairy tales.</li>
      <li>After failing his naval exams and dropping out of architecture school, Saint-Exupéry became relentless in his pursuit of becoming a pilot.</li>
      <li>He eventually got a job delivering airmail with Aéropostale in North Africa and South America.
</li>
      <li>During his time at Aéropostale, Saint-Exupéry published his first text, a short story called L'Aviateur, which was published on April 1, 1926.</li>
      <li> This was followed up in 1929 by his first published book, a novel called Southern Mail, inspired by his experiences as a pilot.</li>
      <li>Saint-Exupéry was a "distracted flier." People said they'd find balled up pieces of paper in the cockpit and there were times Saint-Exupéry refused to land until he finished the novel he was reading.
</li>
